# Redirect http to https

1. Create the `mu-plugins` directory inside of the WordPress `wp-content` directory, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Copy `wp-rocket-https-redirect.php` into this `mu-plugins` directory.
3. Deactivate WP Rocket via the WordPress admin panel.
4. Reactivate WP Rocket.

Now, WordPress should forward all http URL's to https!
