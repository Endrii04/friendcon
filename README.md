# Custom Code For FriendCon

## Development Workflow
This repository is to version control all custom code on our server.
- Make changes here then copy changed files to the server to test/deploy.
(Do this with security copy, aka SCP.)
- Use separate feature branches.
- Merge to `origin/master` when things are good.

## File Organization
- The `root` directory represents the root directory on the server.
