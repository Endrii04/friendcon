# Custom Code For FriendCon

## Development Workflow
This repository is to version control all custom code on our server.
- Make changes here then copy changed files to the server to test/deploy. You can do this with security copy (SCP).
(On Windows, WinSCP is a decent option.)
- Use separate feature branches.
- Merge to `origin/master` when things are good.

## File Organization
- The `root` directory represents the root directory on the server.
- The `sql` directory has some notes for SQL commands.
